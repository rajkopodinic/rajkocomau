                        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Rajko, a web developer based in Sydney, Australia.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after graduating from UTS, I joined the delivery team at Venntifact where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.</p>
